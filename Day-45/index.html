It defines the content and layout of a page by using a series of elements, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images. These elements are enclosed in tags,which tell the browser how to display the content.</h4>

                    <h4>SS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to style and design web pages created with HTML. It allows developers to specify the look and layout of elements, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and the overall design of a web page. CSS helps in creating visually appealing and responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), it ensures a clean, maintainable, and scalable web development process. CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind provide pre-designed components that streamline the styling process.</h4>

                    <h4>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It allows developers to manipulate HTML and CSS elements, handle user inputs, make real-time updates, and interact with external APIs or servers. JavaScript runs directly in the browser, making it essential for tasks like form validation, animations, and building rich web applications. Along with libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, Angular, and React, JavaScript has become a central tool in modern front-end web development, powering complex functionalities and improving the user experience.</h4>

                    <h4>React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where a seamless user experience is a priority. Developed by Facebook, React simplifies the process of creating interactive UIs by using a component-based architecture. Components are reusable, self-contained pieces of UI that react to data changes and update dynamically without reloading the whole page. With features like the Virtual DOM, React optimizes performance by updating only the parts of the user interface that need to change, making it efficient for building modern, high-performance applications.</h4>
