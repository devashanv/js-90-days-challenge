            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the basic structure and layout of web pages by using tags, which are instructions that tell the browser how to display elements like text, images, and links. HTML is not a programming language but a markup language, meaning it organizes and formats the content rather than providing complex functionality. HTML tags are written with opening and closing syntax, and each serves a unique purpose, such as headings, paragraphs, or images. While HTML alone can create static pages, it can be combined with CSS and JavaScript to make web pages more dynamic and interactive. Its latest version, HTML5, introduced new tags and APIs that make it easier to handle multimedia, graphics, and interactive content.

            CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language that enhances the presentation of HTML content on a web page. By controlling aspects such as colors, fonts, and layout, CSS allows web developers to create visually appealing websites and establish a consistent look across multiple pages. CSS works by associating styles with HTML elements through selectors, which specify which elements the styles apply to. It offers different methods for positioning and displaying elements, including flexbox and grid, which enable responsive design. CSS files can be linked externally, making it easy to manage styles across an entire website by updating just one file. With CSS3, additional features like animations, transitions, and transformations were introduced, allowing for more engaging user interfaces.

            features to web pages. It enables developers to create dynamic content, such as image sliders, form validation, and animated graphics, which respond to user actions in real time. JavaScript runs directly in the browser, allowing for quick execution without the need for server-side processing. Modern JavaScript supports asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API, making it ideal for creating responsive, fast-loading applications. It is compatible with HTML and CSS, allowing JavaScript to modify content, apply styles, and manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) in real time. JavaScript has evolved to include frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue, which streamline development and enable building complex single-page applications.
