                JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is widely used to add interactivity to websites. This language allows developers to manipulate the DOM, which enables dynamic changes to HTML and CSS on the page. Supporting both functional and object-oriented programming styles, JavaScript is both flexible and powerful. Modern frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue simplify the process of building complex web applications by providing structured approaches to JavaScript development.
